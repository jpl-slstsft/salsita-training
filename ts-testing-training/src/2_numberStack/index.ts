// Create a class that creates a number stack object.
// The stack should behave like a classic LIFO, where the last number you put in
// is the first one you get out.
// The skeleton for this class has been made for you.  Build out each function
// using test driven development.
// Remember the process -
// - RED:
//   - Write a single test for a small bit of functionality (Don't start writing
//     a test for final, most complex part of the code.  Go slowly, you'll get
//     there)
//   - The test will fail (that's normal)
// - GREEN:
//   - Write the smallest amount of code possible JUST TO MAKE YOUR CURRENT
//     TESTS PASS
//   - Don't worry about having the full functionality yet.  Just make your
//     current tests green.
// - REFACTOR:
//   - Refactor any of your existing code to make it cleaner, you will now know
//     if your changes break any functionality
// - REPEAT:
//   - Start over again from RED, adding another small bit of functionality
