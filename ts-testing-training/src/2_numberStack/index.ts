// Create a class that creates a number stack object.
// The stack should behave like a classic LIFO,
//  where the last number you put in is the first one you get out.
// The skeleton for this class has been made for you.
//  Build out each function using test driven development.
// Remember the process -
// - RED:
//   - Write a single test for a small bit of functionality
//      (Don't start writing a test for final, most complex part of the code.
//      Go slowly, you'll get there).
//   - The test will fail (that's normal).
// - GREEN:
//   - Write the smallest amount of code possible
//      JUST TO MAKE YOUR CURRENT TESTS PASS.
//   - Don't worry about having the full functionality yet.
//      Just make your current tests green.
// - REFACTOR:
//   - Refactor any of your existing code to make it cleaner,
//      you will now know if your changes break any functionality.
// - REPEAT:
//   - Start over again from RED, adding another small bit of functionality.
